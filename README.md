Create a Sorted Linked List that serves as a data structure for the StudentDB. Credit to University of Wisconsin - Madison Computer Science Department for providing the Student.h and SortedList.h files. My personal code can be found in Student.cpp, SortedList.cpp, and main.cpp. Also used Valgrind the find any potential memory leaks.
